        <p className='text-base'>Hey There!!ðŸ‘‹ I am a Full Stack Web Developer. Like to learn new technologies and create something of my own using them. Also have some experience with Blockchain Development and Android Development. 
        <br /><br />
        Currently quite immersed in creating new projects and trying out new frameworks and libraries. ReactJS is something that I have found most interesting and love to work with it. Still grasping over the ReactJS ecosystem and there is still a lot to learn and implement. Its a long journey and I am enjoying it developing and diving into something new always.âœŒðŸ’›ðŸ’›!!!</p>
